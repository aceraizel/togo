### Overview
This is a simple backend for a good old todo service, right now this service can handle login/list/create simple tasks.  
To make it run:
- `docker-compose up --build -d`
- Import Postman collection from `docs` to check example

Candidates are invited to implement below requirements but the point is not to resolve everything in a perfect way but selective what you can do best in a limited time.  
Thus, there is no correct-or-perfect answer, your solutions are way for us to continue the discussion and collaboration.

Missing:
- Write integration tests for this project
- Write unit test for `services` layer
